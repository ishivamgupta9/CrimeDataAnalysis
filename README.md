# US Cities Crime Analysis with Python

This repository contains a collection of data on various cities in the United States and an analysis of this data using Python. The analysis includes the use of popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and data visualization with Plotly and Matplotlib.

## Data

The data in this repository includes information on a wide range of US cities and their crime statistics. I collected this data from US government websites, and I also utilized tools like BeautifulSoup and Selenium for data extraction, particularly for data that was not in the correct format. The dataset includes information such as population, geographical location, climate, and other relevant attributes. This data is provided in various formats, including CSV files, JSON files, or other structured data sources.
## Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to perform data analysis on the provided city data. The analysis covers a variety of aspects, including:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the key statistics of the data, such as mean population, geographical distribution, and more.

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, or any inconsistencies to ensure data quality.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the relationships and patterns within the dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of US cities.

- **Visualization**: Creating informative and insightful visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib to present the analysis results in a visually appealing way.
